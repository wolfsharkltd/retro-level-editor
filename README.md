# Retro Level Editor

## Vision
A vector based level editor for platform games that ultimately outputs palette files, tiles, block data, map data and object data for use in game engines that consume such data formats.

## Mega Drive
Initially being written to support the creation of levels to be used on a mega drive game.

## Building

`TBD`


## Libraries

* SDL2 (included)
* ImGui (included)

## Target platforms

Targeting Win32 for now; trying to remain open to keeping project cross platform but not testing or supporting any other configurations at this time.
